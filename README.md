CodeClan: Project 1 - Web programming with Ruby (Sinatra/SQL/HTML/CSS)


THE BRIEF

We had 4 options: 1-Spending Tracker, 2-Gallery Management App, 3-Gym Member App or 4-Shop Inventory.

I opted for the shop inventory brief - “You have been approached by a shopkeeper who requires an app 
which allows them to keep track of their shops inventory.”

To build the app I've used the MVC pattern. The Models would hold the business logic behind the app. 
The Views would be the parts of the app the user interacts with. The Controller will use Sinatra to bind the functionality of Models to the users' interactions with Views.
